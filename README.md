# Adventures in modern C++ by lanl2tz
In this repository I aim to jot down fragmental stuff that I 
picked up from modern features of C++ (mainly from C++11 and 
its supplementary patches C++14 and C++17).\
I picked up these pieces of modern C++ bits for just two reasons:
- They make writing certain features really easy or efficient.
- Artistry can be derived from the structures implemented using them.\\
We are primarily concerned with C++ 17 as it is well implemented across 
different compilers (Clang, GCC, etc).\
The Clang g++ compiler is used with ```-std=c++17```.
